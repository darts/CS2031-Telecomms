# CS2031-Telecomms
CS2031-Telecommunications


This was work done for the CS2031 module in TCD ICS 2018. 

The scripts are for creating and launching an environment for the application to operate. 
The code is thoroughly commented, although not all of it is very clear. 
I did not plan the layout of the program well enough before starting it (but sure look, it's a learning experience).

The assignments covered are:
- Publish-Subscribe (with)
  - Selective-Repeat
  - Support for multiple brokers, subscribers and publishers
  - Support for very large transmission sizes (data is sectioned and sent)
- OpenFlow (with)
  - Controller (with routing table)
  - Router (now with extra features)
  - Client (although this is more of a shell of a class as it was not particularly important)
